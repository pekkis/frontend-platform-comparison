# Frontend Platform comparison of 2023

Implement a crude version of my [himapage portal](https://www.pekkis.eu) with different frontend meta platforms and publish them in Vercel
to get the hang of where the scene stands.

Focus points:

* Developer experience
* Routing & data fetching
* "Server components" / hydration / island architecture etc
* Performance
* Styling beyond CSS modules (Vanilla Extract)
* Templating, with JSX please.
* Deployment

## Participants


* Next.js -> the original is made with Next.js 13 and acts as the base line reference.
* Qwik (phase 1)
* Astro (phase 1)
* Sveltekit (todo)
* Nuxt (todo)
